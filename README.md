# AI in Medical billing
PITCH - Medical billing-bot
=====================

* Hook:
Did you know that medical billing is one of the most inefficient and error-prone processes in the healthcare system which costs about $125 billion annually in the USA? It is also one of the main reasons for physician burnouts. Our company, Medbot, introduces a unique Artificial Intelligence solution to automate the billing code process.

* Problem:
The medical billing process is complex, time consuming and error prone. Doctors and care practitioners must pair diagnoses to specific medical codes, which is a necessary process because the medical codes regulate medical billing. This leads to payment delays, claim denials, and growing medical debt. With the rise of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and nearly 150k codes, manual annotation of billing processes have become burdensome for providers and payers. 

* Solution:
Our AI-powered medical bot can automate a critical segment of the billing process with Natural Language Processing, and Artificial Intelligence algorithms to generate accurate billing codes faster. 
Our algorithm works using speech to text conversion from patient and physician conversation and automates recording of patient’s symptoms. 
Our clinical Natural language processing tools extract diagnosis and procedure terminologies from clinical notes and convert them into accurate billing codes that can be quickly validated by medical professionals before sending it to the insurance companies.  This simplifies the process and utilizes physician expertise in verifying information rather than rushing to jot it all down.

* Value Proposition:
Our customized solution reduces physicians’ workload, offers higher accuracy, allows for faster reimbursements, decreases claim denials, and improves patient satisfaction.

* Call to Audience:
	    We hope to partner with small healthcare organizations and telehealth providers. Down the line, we would like to incorporate our technology with EHR software companies like Epic and Cerner to leverage our real-time data processing in aggregate analytics. We would greatly appreciate your feedback, and facilitating connections to Hospital systems for our pilot project.
